# Cursor Rules for PocketFlow Development

## Project Context
This is a PocketFlow-based agentic application using Python 3.11+.

## Code Standards
- Always use type hints for function parameters and returns
- Write docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Follow PEP 8 naming conventions
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Ruff standard)
- Use f-strings for string formatting

## PocketFlow Patterns
When creating nodes:
1. Inherit from BaseNode
2. Implement the three-phase lifecycle:
   - prep(): Validate and prepare
   - exec(): Core logic (required)
   - post(): Cleanup and finalize
3. Set action in store to indicate next transition
4. Handle errors gracefully

## Testing
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Use pytest for testing
- Aim for high test coverage
- Test both success and error cases

## Development Workflow
1. Check existing patterns before implementing
2. Use UV for package management
3. Run formatters before committing
4. Ensure type checking passes

## File Organization
- Nodes go in src/nodes/
- Flows go in src/flows/
- Utilities go in src/utils/
- One class/concept per file when practical

## Documentation
- Update relevant docs when changing functionality
- Use clear, descriptive variable names
- Comment complex logic
- Keep README up to date
